# Implementing the Open-Closed Principle in Laravel
Open Closed principle is the 2nd principle of the SOLID principle. In SOLID O is stand for Open Closed principle. Open Closed principle means A class/method should be open for extension but closed for modification, which means you can change behavior without modifying source code. The main idea of this principle is to keep existing code from breaking when you implement new features, which means extending functionality by adding new code instead of changing existing code.
